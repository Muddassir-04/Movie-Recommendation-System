# Movie Recommendation System using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project implements a movie recommendation system leveraging deep learning techniques. The model analyzes user preferences and provides personalized movie suggestions. It uses collaborative filtering, a common approach in recommendation systems, to understand users' ratings and preferences. Built using Python, it applies deep learning frameworks to predict movie ratings, enabling a highly personalized viewing experience.

## Key Features
- **Deep Learning Model**: Uses a neural network-based approach for collaborative filtering.
- **Data Processing**: Cleans and processes movie and user data to create a training dataset.
- **Training and Prediction**: Trains the model on historical user ratings to generate accurate movie recommendations.
- **Evaluation**: Assesses model performance to ensure high accuracy in recommendations.

## Project Structure
- `data/` - Directory containing datasets of movie information and user ratings.
- `notebooks/` - Contains the Jupyter Notebook for building and training the recommendation model.
- `src/` - Python scripts for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- `README.md` - Overview and setup instructions for the project.

## Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset containing user ratings and movie details. Each entry includes:
- **User ID**: Identifies individual users.
- **Movie ID**: Uniquely identifies each movie.
- **Rating**: The rating provided by a user for a specific movie.
- **Timestamp**: The date and time the rating was given.


## Usage
The model can be used to recommend movies by:
1. Providing a user ID to retrieve recommendations based on their past preferences.
2. Adjusting model parameters in the notebook for experimentation.

## Deep Learning Model Details
- **Architecture**: The model uses an embedding layer for users and movies, followed by dense layers to predict ratings.
- **Training**: Trained using mean squared error as the loss function, optimized with Adam optimizer.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluated using accuracy metrics to ensure high-quality recommendations.

## Results
The trained model provides recommendations with a high level of accuracy, as verified through the testing phase. Adjustments to parameters like embedding size, number of layers, and epochs can further enhance performance.

## Future Improvements
- **Integration with Content-Based Filtering**: Combine with content-based filtering for better recommendations.
- **Real-Time Recommendations**: Implement real-time recommendations by deploying the model as an API.
- **Sentimental Analysis**: currently this project is based on deep learning, further we can make it more efficient by implementing sentimental analysis.
